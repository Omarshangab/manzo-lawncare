Perfect Chuck - You need to break up large blocks of text, as chunks are hated by vistors

50 - 75 characters or about 600px to 700px with a line break ever two to 3 sentences 

Bullet points are very useful and the brain loves them, however bullet points that aren’t in the correct spot, not lineup evenly or don’t even make sense will turn a visitor off faster than bad hygiene 

The Consistent Spacing system: people often say they want a really clean website, all that really  means is that aren’t things are sized and spaced random, there’s a method to it, a rhuthm to it that makes the layout easy to navigate and predictable for the user

Introducing the 8 point grid system → all elements are spaced by multiples of 8

1. start with a baseline value
2. separate groups by at least double 
3. keep the distance between big groups similar 

Use ratios for line height → Display Headers 1:1 ration

paragraph → 1:1.5 ratio

Letter spacing rules

Display FONTS → -1px → remember your optimizing for scan ability 

Body text → 0px → remember your optimizing for legality 

CTA → 1px → remember your optimizing for Click ability

Always apply and optimize these rules to mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes

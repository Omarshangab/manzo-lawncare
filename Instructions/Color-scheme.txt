Now the palette you should actually use
Base layer
White: #FFFFFF
This should be 70–80% of the page.
Primary text
Near-black, not pure black: #1C1C1C
Pure black is harsher and lowers reading comfort.
Secondary text
Muted dark gray: #5F5F5F
Used for descriptions, not headlines.
Brand accents derived from logo
Do not invent new colors. Just control intensity.
Green
Primary green: #3C872B
Use sparingly. Buttons, icons, checkmarks, section dividers.
Dark green variant for hover states
#2F6A22
Yellow
Accent only: #FCCA2F
Use for highlights, badges, subtle emphasis.
Never use yellow for body text. Contrast failure.
Brown
Supporting accent: #451108
Use for footer background, logo text, or thin separators.
Do not use brown for large content blocks. It kills clarity.
Optional neutral background for sections
Soft off-white: #F7F7F7
Used to separate sections without adding color noise.
What not to do
Do not put green backgrounds behind large text blocks.
Do not mix multiple greens.
Do not add blues or oranges “for contrast.” That breaks brand coherence.
Do not darken the whole site to look “premium.” Lawn care is not luxury, it’s reliability.
Visual hierarchy rule
White carries structure
Black carries information
Green carries action
Yellow carries attention
Brown anchors brand identity
If you violate that order, the site will feel amateur even if the colors are technically fine.
